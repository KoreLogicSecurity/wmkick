1 Overview

  WMkick is a TCP protocol redirector/MITM tool that targets NTLM
  authentication message flows in WMI (135/tcp) and
  Powershell-Remoting/WSMan/WinRM (5985/tcp) to capture NetNTLMv2
  hashes. Once a hash has been captured, popular cracking tools such
  as Hashcat and JtR can be used to recover plaintext passwords.
  WMkick automates the hash extraction process and alleviates the
  need to build/use a WMI (or WSMAN) Auth Server or perform manual
  packet analysis.

  A use case for WMkick is for internal penetration tests.  If the
  penetration tester can redirect these protocols to their own
  Windows virtual machine or remote target hosting WMI or WSMan
  services, it is possible to obtain a valid NetNTLMv2 hash, which
  can be cracked into a plaintext credential, in order to go from
  a non-credentialed to credentialed perspective.  A possible
  situation that may be observed in the target environment is
  software or administrative scripts running remote WMI or WSMan
  commands over a subnet in which wmkick is running, the attacker
  may take advantage of this.
